# PSR-0 and PSR-4 Class Autoloader #

*Classloader* is a PHP library for autoloading classes. Class autoloading means
that classes are loaded only when they are actually needed instead of having to
include each class file on every execution. This reduces the page loading
overhead especially on larger websites, as only some of the class files need to
be loaded. Usually the classes are also loaded dynamically from files with file
names based on the namespace and class name. This also makes it easier to
manage a large number of class files.

This library supports two of the current standards for autoloading classes,
namely the [PSR-0](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-0/) and [PSR-4](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/).
The basic idea behind these standards is that class files reside in directories
based on their namespace and in files named after the class. The key difference
between these two standards is that PSR-4 does not require the entire namespace
to be present in the directory hierarchy.

However, since the operation of finding the actual class files tends to be
relatively costly, this library also provides basic caching mechanisms that
allow caching the class file locations in a PHP file. With caching, the 
performance difference between autoloading and loading the files manually
becomes negligible.

## Requirements ##

  * The minimum supported PHP version is 5.6

## Installation ##

### Installation with Composer ###

The easiest way to install this library is to use Composer to handle your
dependencies. In order to install this library via Composer, simply follow
these two steps:

  1. Acquire the `composer.phar` by running the Composer
     [Command-line installation](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
     in your project root.

  2. Once you have run the installation script, you should have the `composer.phar`
     file in you project root and you can run the following command:

     ```
     php composer.phar require "riimu/kit-classloader:^4.4"
     ```

After installing this library via Composer, you can load the library by
including the `vendor/autoload.php` file that was generated by Composer during
the installation.

### Adding the library as a dependency ###

If you are already familiar with how to use Composer, you may alternatively add
the library as a dependency by adding the following `composer.json` file to your
project and running the `composer install` command:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "riimu/kit-classloader": "^4.4"
    }
}
```

### Manual installation ###

If you do not wish to use Composer to load the library, you may also download
the library manually by downloading the [latest release](https://github.com/Riimu/Kit-ClassLoader/releases/latest)
and extracting the `src` folder to your project. You may then include the
provided `src/autoload.php` file to load the library classes.

## Usage ##

The `ClassLoader` supports autoloading as defined by the PSR-0 and PSR-4
standards via the methods `addBasePath()` and `addPrefixPath()` respectively.
You do not need to understand these standards to use this library, simply use
the method that works best for you.

### PSR-0 class autoloading ###

PSR-0 class autoloading defines that class files must be placed in a directory
tree that reflects their namespace. For example, the class 'Foo\Bar\Baz' could
be located in a file '/path/to/classes/Foo/Bar/Baz.php'. This method is usually
the simplest way to place your class files.

Using the `addBasePath()` method, you can define the base directories where to
look for classes. To load the class mentioned above, you could use the
following code:

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';
$loader = new Riimu\Kit\ClassLoader\ClassLoader();
$loader->addBasePath('/path/to/classes/');
$loader->register();

$obj = new Foo\Bar\Baz();
```

If a specific directory only applies to a specific namespace, you can use the
second parameter to define the namespace as well. However, The directory still
needs to point to the base directory for the namespace. For example:

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';
$loader = new Riimu\Kit\ClassLoader\ClassLoader();
$loader->addBasePath('/path/to/classes/', 'Foo\Bar');
$loader->register();

$obj = new Foo\Bar\Baz();
```

Note that PSR-0 also states that underscores in the class name are treated as
namespace separators (but not underscores in namespaces). So, even if your class
was called 'Foo\Bar_Baz', both of the above examples would still work.
Even if your class namespaces are defined using underscores in the class name,
you need to use backslashes in the namespace argument.

### PSR-4 class autoloading ###

Unlike PSR-0, the PSR-4 class autoloading standard does not require classes to
be placed in a directory tree that reflects their entire namespace. Instead,
part of the namespace can be replaced by a specific path.

For example, if your class 'Foo\Bar\Baz' was located in the file
'/path/to/Library/Baz.php', you could register the path using `addPrefixPath()`
and specifying the namespace as demonstrated in the following example:

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';
$loader = new Riimu\Kit\ClassLoader\ClassLoader();
$loader->addPrefixPath('/path/to/Library/', 'Foo\Bar');
$loader->register();

$obj = new Foo\Bar\Baz();
```

This allows much shorter directory structures as the entire namespace does not
need to be reflected in the directory tree. It's also possible to omit the
namespace argument, in which case the path will work the same as paths added via
`addBasePath()`, except for the fact that underscores in the class name will not
be treated as namespace separators.

### Adding multiple paths ###

While you could simply call the path adding methods multiple times, it's
possible to add multiple paths using an array. This usually makes configuration
much easier. For example, you could add multiple base paths by providing an
array:

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';
$loader = new Riimu\Kit\ClassLoader\ClassLoader();
$loader->addPrefixPath([
    '/path/to/classes/',
    '/other/path/',
]);
$loader->register();
```

Or you could add namespace specific paths by providing an associative array that
defines the namespaces using the array keys:

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';
$loader = new Riimu\Kit\ClassLoader\ClassLoader();
$loader->addPrefixPath([
    'Foo\Bar' => '/path/to/classes/',
    'Other\Namesapace' => ['/other/path/', '/some/other'],
]);
$loader->register();
```

As shown in the example above, you can also provide an list of paths for
specific namespace.

### Caching ###

Looking for classes in the filesystem on each request is a costly affair. It is
highly recommended to cache the file locations so that they do not need to be
searched on every request. After all, the class files do not tend to move around
in the file system.

This library provides a very simple caching system via `FileCacheClassLoader`.
The class stores the file locations in a single PHP file which is loaded on
every request instead of searching for the files manually.

The usage of the `FileCacheClassLoader` does not differ much from using the
`ClassLoader`. You simply need to provide the path to a writable cache file in
the constructor. The file will be used to store the class locations and will be
rewritten when new class files are discovered. For example:

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';
$loader = new Riimu\Kit\ClassLoader\FileCacheClassLoader(__DIR__ . '/cache.php');
$loader->addBasePath('/path/to/classes/');
$loader->register();
```
